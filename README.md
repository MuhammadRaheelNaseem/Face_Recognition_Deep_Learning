# Face_Recognition_Deep_Learning
Face recognition is a technique that uses a picture, video, or other audiovisual feature of a person's face to identify or authenticate him. This identifier is often used to get access to a programme, system, or service. It is a biometric identification approach that employs body measurements, in this instance the face and head, to authenticate a person's identity by looking at their facial biometric pattern and data. To identify, verify, and/or authenticate a person, the technology captures a collection of unique biometric data related with their face and facial expression.
